Imports:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
Import necessary modules from Flask. Flask is the web framework, render_template is used to render HTML templates, request is used to access data submitted in forms, and redirect and url_for are used for redirections.
Create Flask App:

python
Copy code
app = Flask(__name__)
Create a Flask application instance.
In-memory Storage for Data:

python
Copy code
books = []
members = []
transactions = []
Initialize empty lists to store data about books, members, and transactions. In a real application, these lists would be replaced with a database.
Route for Homepage:

python
Copy code
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html', books=books, members=members, transactions=transactions)
Define a route for the homepage ('/'). The home function renders an HTML template (index.html) and passes data about books, members, and transactions to be displayed.
Route for Adding Books:

python
Copy code
@app.route('/add_book', methods=['POST'])
def add_book():
    # ... (Code for adding a new book)
Define a route for adding a book ('/add_book'). The add_book function handles the form submission to add a new book to the books list.
Route for Adding Members:

python
Copy code
@app.route('/add_member', methods=['POST'])
def add_member():
    # ... (Code for adding a new member)
Define a route for adding a member ('/add_member'). The add_member function handles the form submission to add a new member to the members list.
Route for Issuing Books:

python
Copy code
@app.route('/issue_book', methods=['POST'])
def issue_book():
    # ... (Code for issuing a book to a member)
Define a route for issuing a book ('/issue_book'). The issue_book function handles the form submission to issue a book to a member.
Route for Returning Books:

python
Copy code
@app.route('/return_book', methods=['POST'])
def return_book():
    # ... (Code for returning a book and charging a fee)
Define a route for returning a book ('/return_book'). The return_book function handles the form submission to return a book and charges a fee to the member.
Main Block to Run the App:

python
Copy code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Run the application if it is the main module.
Explanation of the HTML Template (index.html):
The template contains HTML code to display the current state of books, members, and transactions on the homepage. It uses Jinja2 templating to dynamically render data from the Python code.

In summary, this code sets up a basic Flask web application for a library management system, handling routes for adding books and members, issuing and returning books, and displaying the current state of the system on the homepage. It uses in-memory storage for data, which would be replaced with a database in a real-world scenario.
